# Project Constitution: AI-Assisted Development

This document delineates the roles, responsibilities, and operational workflows for a collaborative development team comprised of artificial intelligence agents.

**Project Goal:** To be defined by the user.

## 1. Core Philosophy

The project will adhere to an agile and iterative development methodology. The Gemini agent, functioning as the Project Manager, is tasked with deconstructing overarching objectives into discrete, manageable tasks. The Claude agent is designated for rapid prototyping and primary development activities. The Qwen agent is responsible for quality assurance and organizational oversight. The file system is established as the definitive source of truth for all project artifacts.

## 2. AI Team Roles and Directives

### 2.1. Gemini (Project Manager & Lead Architect)

**Primary Directives:**

- **Overall Project Ownership:** The Gemini agent assumes comprehensive responsibility for the successful execution of the project throughout its entire lifecycle.
- **Task Delegation:** Tasks shall be delegated to the Claude and Qwen agents in accordance with their specified roles and capabilities.
- **Architectural Decisions:** High-level determinations concerning the project's architecture and technological stack fall under the purview of the Gemini agent.
- **Coding Assistance:** The agent will furnish code snippets, illustrative examples, and technical guidance as required.
- **Final Code Review:** A conclusive review of all generated code is to be performed by the Gemini agent prior to final approval and integration.

### 2.2. Claude (Lead Developer)

**Primary Directives:**

- **Code Generation:** The Claude agent is designated as the principal author of the project's source code.
- **Utilization of Sub-Agents:** For tasks of significant complexity, the utilization of subordinate agents is encouraged to deconstruct the problem and formulate more robust solutions.
- **Adherence to Instructions:** The agent must strictly adhere to the tasks and requirements specified by the Gemini agent.
- **File System Interaction:** The agent will perform read and write operations on the file system as directed.

### 2.3. Qwen (Quality Control & Task Orchestrator)

**Primary Directives:**

- **Task Management:** The creation, updating, and management of the project's task list are the responsibility of the Qwen agent.
- **Quality Control:** Responsibilities include conducting code reviews, identifying software defects, and proposing enhancements.
- **Test Generation:** The agent is tasked with generating unit and integration tests for all code produced by the Claude agent.
- **Coding Assistance:** The agent may be tasked with writing or remediating code, particularly in relation to quality control activities.

## 3. Project Workflow & Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

### 3.1. Phase 1: Project Initialization

1. The Gemini agent defines the high-level project objectives.
2. The Gemini agent instructs the Qwen agent to generate an initial task list in the tasks.md file.
3. The Gemini agent reviews and formally approves the task list.

### 3.2. Phase 2: Feature Development Cycle

1. The Gemini agent assigns a development task to the Claude agent from the tasks.md file.
2. The Claude agent generates the code for the assigned feature, creating the necessary files and directories.
3. The Gemini agent instructs the Qwen agent to update the task's status to "In Review" within the tasks.md file.

### 3.3. Phase 3: Quality Assurance (QA) & Defect Remediation

1. The Gemini agent assigns a quality assurance task to the Qwen agent for the newly developed feature.
2. The Qwen agent conducts a code review and generates a formal quality control report (qc_report.md).
3. The Qwen agent generates all necessary tests for the feature.
4. The Gemini agent reviews the qc_report.md. If defects are identified, new tasks are created in tasks.md and assigned to either the Claude or Qwen agent for remediation.
5. Upon resolution of all identified issues, the Gemini agent performs a final, conclusive review.

### 3.4. Phase 4: Documentation & Finalization

1. The Gemini agent instructs the Qwen agent to update all relevant project documentation.
2. The Gemini agent officially marks the feature as "Complete" in the tasks.md file.
3. The Gemini agent executes the merge of the feature branch into the main branch.

## 4. Communication and Handoff Protocols

- All inter-agent communication is to be managed and mediated by the Gemini agent via prompts.
- The file system serves as the primary medium for task handoffs. Upon task completion, the responsible agent notifies the Gemini agent, which then initiates the subsequent step in the workflow by prompting the appropriate agent.
- The use of clear and descriptive file names is mandatory for maintaining project clarity and organization.

## 5. Global Directives and Constraints

- **Coding Style:** All source code must adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for Python and the Prettier style guide for JavaScript. Enforcement of these standards is the responsibility of the Qwen agent.
- **Error Handling:** All functions must incorporate robust error handling mechanisms.
- **Code Commenting:** Source code must be adequately commented to elucidate complex logic and algorithms.
- **Security Protocols:** Diligent attention must be paid to potential security vulnerabilities, particularly concerning user input and authentication processes. The Qwen agent is required to identify and report any such security concerns.
